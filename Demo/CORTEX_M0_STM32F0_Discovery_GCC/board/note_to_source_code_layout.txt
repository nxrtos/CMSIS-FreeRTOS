            --	CMSIS_5

1. STM32CubeF0
It needs STM32CubeF0 to put at side by side to the root of this repo.
The package of STM32CubeF0 can be find at

https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeF0.git
or 
https://github.com/nxrtos/STM32CubeF0.git

Actully the package of STM32CubeF0 is a combination package contains
more packages inside.  For this project uses following packages.
	STM32F0xx_HAL_Driver    at  STM32CubeF0/Drivers/STM32F0xx_HAL_Driver
	CMSIS_Device_STM32F0xx  at  STM32CubeF0/Drivers/CMSIS/Device/ST/STM32F0xx


2. CMSIS_5
It needs CMSIS_5 to put at side by side to the root of this repo.
The package of CMSIS_5 can be find at

https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5.git
or 
https://github.com/nxrtos/CMSIS_5.git

Uses the part of CMSIS_Core_Include.  This part can actually be find
in STM32CubeF0 at STM32CubeF0/Drivers/CMSIS/Core/Include/ but be a
different version.

3. CMSIS_5_CMSIS_RTOS2_FreeRTOS

This package can be find at CMSIS-FreeRTOS/CMSIS/RTOS2/FreeRTOS/
It looks need little more effort to integrate into the project. 
So at this moment use 
{Project_Root_Dir}/Packages/CMSIS_5/CMSIS/RTOS2/FreeRTOS
